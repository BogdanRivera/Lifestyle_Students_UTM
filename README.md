<p id="description">In this project the main clustering algorithms such as K-means K-modes and K-prototypes are used. The particular case is applied to a survey carried out on students of the Technological University of the Mixteca (UTM) where the use of clustering is useful to verify which factors mainly influence the health of students.</p>
